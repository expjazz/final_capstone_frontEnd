# Work For All - A full stack application to get your dream jobs

This is a full-fledge application that allows companies to post jobs, and users to apply for them. IT also shows the info of the company to users and users to companies, but with restrictions to provide security.

## How to use it

As a company, you can post job offers, and then after the user respond to it, you can accept the application. If you do, then the user needs to suggest a time to do a interview. Afterwards, you can either accept the time the user proposed, or propose a new one.

As an candidate, you can apply to a new job. If the company accepts you, you have the option to schedule a interview. If they accept your time good. If not, then they will suggest a new time, and you can either accept or suggest a new one, until is good for boot pars.

#### Sometimes you might need to refresh to get a updatee on the information. I will work on this as I go foward with action cable on the backend.

### Next Steps

- I will do action cable on rails, to allow realtime update as soon as it hits the database.
- A live chat with inbox message, in which the company and candidates can talk.

It features a lot of different models and associations, a RESTfull¬†API, Redux for managing the store, and many restrictions so the information gets secure.
